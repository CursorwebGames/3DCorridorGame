# Gorple Game
Gorple is an alien entity residing in the subconscious mind. He is trapped there, and can only communicate with the real world using the subconcious part of weak minds.

He has been able to create a mysterious shake which transports victims to his dimension.

In his dimension, there are 4 constructs (aka levels).
1. The Lobby construct (backrooms-like)
1. The Labyrinth construct (maze-like w/ going up and down?)
1. The Plains (cube game!)

There are many mobs:
## Character

## Boom-Bombs
They try and walk to you and then explode

## Crawly Bug
Spider-like entity

## Flying Roach

## Children of the Gorple Mind
Cloaked with robes, is this what gorple does to it's victims? Uses ranged weapons.

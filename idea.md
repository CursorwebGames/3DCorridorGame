# Gorple Game
Gorple is an alien entity residing in the subconscious mind. He is trapped there, and can only communicate with the real world using the subconcious part of weak minds.

He has been able to create a mysterious shake which transports victims to his dimension.

In his dimension, there are 4 constructs (aka levels).
1. The Lobby construct (backrooms-like)
    - Chance for stairs to go up to something ... with loot
1. The Labyrinth construct (maze-like w/ going up and down?)
1. The Plains (cube game!)
    - Spawn castles with loot? and monster

There are many mobs:
## Dummy
The most basic of them all, humanoid dummies, probably the first things gorple made.

## Boom-Bombs
They try and walk to you and then explode

## Crawly Bug
Spider-like entity

## Flying Roach
Can FLY! Swoops down to bite you.

## Spiked Rock
Slow but hurts you if you touch it, and hurts you if you hurt it
rolls at enemies
drops good loot though...

## Lava Robot
Shoots out mini spiked rocks

## Children of the Gorple Mind
Cloaked with robes, is this what gorple does to it's victims? Casts spells.
